# Deep-Learning-
Deep learning is a AI framwork that enables the machine to perform complex operations like pattern recognition , image processing , time series predictions and mcuh more. The major libraries that empower us to develop deep learning models are keras, Torch , caffee, microsft CNTK and tensorflow which is developed and maintained by google. A deep learning model enables the machine to perform a operation and improve its performance at it all by itself without any to minimum human intervention. 

Here we develop models by using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCv for most of the projects since they have a very well defined documentation and easy to understand code.

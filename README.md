# Deep-Learning-
Deep learning is process of training a deep neural network to perform complex operations like pattern recognition , image processing , time series predictions and much more.The major libraries that have been used in this repository are OpenCV and Tensorflow. 

Here we develop models by using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCv for most of the projects since they have a very well defined documentation and easy to understand code.
